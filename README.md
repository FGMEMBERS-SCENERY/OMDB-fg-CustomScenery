# OMDB-fg-CustomScenery
Dubai Scenery for Flightgear with OMDB and OMDW

* OMDB airport layout by gateway artist Litjan
* terrain with osm coastline, water, (some) roads by d-laser
* skyscrapers by Julien Nguyen
* 3D terminal & hangar models by d-laser
* textures by d-laser and gsagostinho


## optional: 

* buildings made with osm2city
* object locations for project3000 shared objects - you will need the project3000/Models/lib folder from here:
http://media.lug-marl.de/flightgear/project3000-Nov2015.tgz or from here:  
https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools/tree/master/Models/lib


## how to use:

    fgfs --fg-scenery=/scenery/OMDB-fg-CustomScenery

optional:


    fgfs--fg-scenery=/scenery/OMDB-fg-CustomScenery/project3000  
    --fg-scenery=/scenery/OMDB-fg-CustomScenery/osm2city    
    --fg-scenery=/scenery/OMDB-fg-CustomScenery


## known bugs:
* some buildings have to be removed from the osm2city folder because static 3D models exist.
* project3000-generated passenger bridges between terminal and satellite buildings are too short
* bad elevation for osm roads
* terrain(terragear) roads only in the downtown area
